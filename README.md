# magnificATS

A collection of various programming exercises I have done in ATS.

### EXPRESSION

[EXPRESSION](./EXPRESSSION) provides a way of creating and manipulating expressions involving a single variable X (polynomials in X). These expressions can be evaluated for a given X value, simplified given identity and distribution rules, and compared to other expressions for equality.

### LAMBDA

[LAMBDA](./LAMBDA) is a small programming language that provides an interface for creating lambda functions and developing/ interpreting lambda calculus examples.

### RECURSION

[RECURSION](./RECURSION) is a collection of algorithms written in a recursive style. You will find some dynamic programming, graph search, and other fun problems here.

### STATISTICS

[STATISTICS](./STATISTICS) is a library of basic statistical functions written in various styles. An interface for performing Linear Regression in 2D is provided.
